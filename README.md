# Gestural Sound Toolkit V2

Toolkit in Max/MSP for gesture-to-sound scenario prototyping. 


## Install

Clone the repo:
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ircam-ismm/Gestural-Sound-Toolkit.git 
```

The toolkit makes use of the MuBu lib developed by the ISMM team at IRCAM. This a Max/MSP library that is free avaaialble as Max Package (in the Package manager), or freely available at the Forum Ircam

`https://forum.ircam.fr/projects/detail/mubu/` 
(necessary to register to the IRCAM forum [spam-free])

THe MuBu package must be either copied in the Max Package folder, or referenced in the Files Preference: `Options > File Preferences > +`

**Note for Windows' users**: you need to install Visual Studio 2015 Redistributable Package to have MuBu working!

This toolkit has been designed and implemented in order to investigate research questions on sonic interaction design, and led to a publication at the CHI 2015 conference. If you use the toolkit in your research or teaching, please credit our work:
