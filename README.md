# Gestural Sound Toolkit

Toolkit in Max/MSP for easy and fast gesture-to-sound scenario prototyping. 

## Install

Clone the repo:
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/bcaramiaux/Gestural-Sound-Toolkit 
```

The toolkit heavly relies on the MuBu lib developed by the ISMM team at IRCAM. This a Max/MSP library that is free (only to register to the IRCAM forum [that doesn't spam]): http://forumnet.ircam.fr/product/mubu-en/. 

**Note for Windows' users**: you need to install Visual Studio 2015 Redistributable Package to have MuBu working! 

Once downloaded, add the Mubu library into the `ext-libs` folder within the GST.

Last step: in MaxMSP add all the toolkit to your file preferences: `Options > File Preferences > +`


## Credits

This toolkit has been designed and implemented in order to investigate research questions on sonic interaction design, and led to a publication at the CHI 2015 conference. If you use the toolkit in your research or teaching, please credit our work:
